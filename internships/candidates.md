Successful candidates are professionally minded individuals seeking fulfilling opportunities for
personal advancement. Our interns often possess a natural ability and some education in their chosen
field, and require only some direction, mentorship and experience to fully develop their skills.

Depending on your skill-set and career goals, we will place you in a role such as business analyst,
project manager, or human resources specialist. You will earn a competitive salary for 52 weeks, and
benefit from continuous mentoring by senior resources. And you will also work with us on our client
projects with the possibility of securing a permanent position.
