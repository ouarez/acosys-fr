**Be a leader in Indigenous professional development.**

Become a partner in the Acosys Aboriginal Internship Program (AIP).

A subsidized Indigenous resource provides a low-risk path to greater workforce inclusiveness. This
ignites your Indigenous network growth, sets off an upward spiral of inclusion, and helps you meet
reporting goals.

There are several additional reasons to consider taking on an Indigenous intern:

- Education: Our education partners provide our interns with discounted coursework in business
analysis, project management, and human resources.
- No hiring fees at the end of the internship if the Intern is moved from our payroll to yours.
- Acosys provides mentoring support to both the Intern and the Client Partner.
- We take responsibility for the quality of our Interns' work.

The commitment needed from the client partner is a project that gives strong industry experience, a
stimulating work environment in which an Intern might sharpen his or her skills, and a desire to help
others succeed.
