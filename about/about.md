## Providing Direction

Acosys is an Indigenous consulting firm with different ideas. We have expertise in business solutions, technology integration, and talent management.

We opened our doors in 2006, co-founded by David Acco and Julie Lepage. Their identities, their vision of social entrepreneurship, and their expertise in the fields of Information Technology and Human Resources made Acosys what it is.

Since then, our history of efficient delivery and satisfied clients has given us a solid foundation, on which weâ€™ve built a reputation for creative and progressive solutions catering to nearly every major industry.

In 2011, Acosys was awarded the Small Business of the Year award by the Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council for our strong numbers and new ideas. In 2012, Acosys was awarded a Business Excellence Award from the Toronto Board of Trade for our leadership and demonstrated success in Indigenous inclusion.

## Community Connections

While we wish to be recognized on the strength of our expertise and
consistent delivery, we are also proud to be an Indigenous company.

As a registered and certified supplier with the Procurement Strategy for
Aboriginal Business (PSAB), the Canadian Aboriginal and Minority
Supplier Council (CAMSC), and the Canadian Council for Aboriginal
Business (CCAB), we can throw open the doors to a panoramic
professional and Indigenous network.
