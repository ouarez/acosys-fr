![Acosys Brand](/img/acosys-brand.png)

Four arrows, forming a diamond: in many Indigenous cultures this symbolizes the four
cardinal directions, North, South, East, and West. The dark squares, in the shape of a
teepee, represent the familial bond – in business terms, teamwork. Combined with our
name, taken from the Cree word for ‘arrow,’ you have our business ideal: effective and
team-based direction to our clients, through a 360° vision.
