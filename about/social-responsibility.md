## Giving back to the community.

We’re a for-profit business, but we have a self-defined social mission centered on Indigenous diversity and inclusion.

Our goal is to raise the visibility of Indigenous professionals in the private sector, by providing meaningful professional opportunities in education and employment. And we actively pursue this mission every day, in several ways:

1. **Commitment to Indigenous Inclusion internally**. Commitment to Indigenous Inclusion internally. We maintain and exceed a self-imposed 33% Indigenous human resources component in our company and in project delivery.
2. **Indigenous Talent Management services**. We have assisted a number of customers in developing a full-cycle HR recruitment and integration strategy targeting Indigenous professionals.
3. **An Innovative Aboriginal Internship Program (AIP)**. We provide our interns with project roles and mentorship to build the skills and experience they need in becoming in-demand professionals. Thus far we've had 12 success stories and a 100 per cent success rate.
4. **Giving back**. We have delivered seminars and workshops to Indigenous communities and organizations, as well as to corporate customers, free of charge. We place special focus on Indigenous economic development, capacity building, and workforce inclusion.
