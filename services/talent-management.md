**Help your team grow.**
We assist our clients from recruitment, to retention, to policy advice. We also assist both their business
units and recruiters in engaging resources, and readying the candidates themselves for the client’s
business and operations. This attention to detail stems from our formal training as Certified Human
Resources Professionals, our experience of what works and what doesn’t, and the knowledge that each
of our customers has its own "on the ground" reality.

**Our services include:**

### Indigenous Talent Management

Attracting Indigenous talent requires unique strategies, and even once recruited, your Indigenous
resources have unique needs in the workplace. Whether you’re an Indigenous or non-Indigenous
organization, we can help you manage your talent more effectively. We have assisted a number of
customers in developing a full-cycle HR recruitment and integration strategy targeting Indigenous
professionals.

### Recruitment and Screening

Our talent management team has been training in a rigorous methodology that ensures our talent
responds fully and directly to your requirements, within your timelines.

### Training
From developing, organizing, delivering, and evaluating, to cross-industry benchmarking. Acosys has
created and delivered live workshops and online courses in Human Resources Management, Critical
Thinking for Decision Makers, and others.

### Policy Development

Make sure your policies and workforce comply with the latest provincial and federal legislation. We
can help you with Harassment Policy, Contractor Policy, Employee Guidelines/Integration, and more.

### Employee Relations

Morale affects productivity. We offer a suite of services, including exit and satisfaction interviews,
employee and management coaching, and issue resolution.
