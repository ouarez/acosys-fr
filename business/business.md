**Building bridges between private industry, Indigenous communities, and government.**

We act as the preferred liaison in enabling community, corporate, and government stakeholders to
create vital and profitable relationships. This role is complemented by our [Aboriginal Internship
Program](/internships), which brings together government organizations, private sector partners, Indigenous
professionals, and even educational institutions, to act together as an incubator for Indigenous talent.

Like many companies, we concentrate on offering expertise in our field, delivery that meets or exceeds
client expectations, and building lasting business partnerships. Unlike many, we also have had an
inclusion mission integrated into our business model.

**Supply Chain Inclusion**

Our business model centers on Indigenous Inclusion and Capacity Building. We always maintain, at
minimum, a 33% Indigenous human resources component in **project delivery**. In other words, not only
administrative assistants, but certified business analysts, recruiters, human resource professionals,
project managers, programmers, subject matter experts, and so on. This is a self-imposed rule, aimed at
developing Indigenous talent in the professional world, then translated into community enhancement,
self-sufficiency, and greater empowerment for Canadian Indigenous peoples.

Today, approximately 70% of Acosysâ€™s workforce is Indigenous, including full-time and part-time
employees. This **shatters** the standards for Indigenous business set by all governing and certifying
organizations. Our clients often leverage our commitment to invigorate their own inclusion and
corporate social responsibility programs and meet their reporting requirements.
